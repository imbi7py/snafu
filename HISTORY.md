# Release History

## Next (not released)

### UI Changes

* Remove confusing `activate` and `deactivate` commands in favour of the `use` command. The previous “reactivation” behaviour is now mapped to `link --all`.
* Add `snafu upgrade self` to perform in-place upgrade without manually downloading the installer.
* Add `snafu download <version>` to download installer of given Python version without installing.
* More complete help messages are provided to command arguments.

### Behavioural Changes

* Call `snafu link --all` automatically after installing with a shimmed pip command.
* Upgrade Python 3.4 definition to 3.4.4.
* Improve script copy logic in `link` to speed up the process and reduce cluttering output.
* Improve behaviour when uninstalling versions not installed by SNAFU.
* Py Launcher usage is reduced in favour of reading the registry ourselves.
* Documentation is no longer installed with each Python version.

### Installer Changes

* Add an option to install and use a Python version after SNAFU is set up.
* 64-bit variant does not carry x86 MSU files anymore, reducing installer size.
* Correctly install Windows update KB2999226 on 32-bit Windows.


## Version 1.0

### UI Changes

* New `upgrade` command to install a newer patch version on an installed version.
* New `link` command to manually publish a script from the active Python versions.

### Behavioural Changes

* `pip-X.Y` are now published on install.
* Automatically deactivate an uninstalling active version.
* A Python exception will be raised early on download error, instead of failing later during installation.
* Uninstallation now skips gracefully if launcher scripts do not exist.

### Installer Changes

* Bundle and trigger Windows update KB2999226 on installation to provide necessary runtime files on Windows Vista to 8.1 so the bundled Python 3.6 can run correctly.
* Environment variables changes can now propagate correctly without OS restart.


## Version 0.2

### UI Changes

* `uninstall` now attempts to use Windows’s uninstall feature to avoid re-download.
* `install` and `uninstall` receives a `--file` option to allow using local installers without re-downloading.
  **IMPORTANT:** Correctness of the installer is not checked. The user is responsible for choosing the correct and valid installer file. Results of installing a faulty installer is undefined.
* New command `where` to show where the actual interpreter is. This is useful if you need to pass it to another command (e.g. `pipenv --python`).
* `list` shows activeness.
* `snafu --version` shows program version.

### Behavioural Changes

* `activate` writes a pin file showing the current active versions.
* Symbols in `snafu list` are changed.

### Installer Changes

* Environment variables are now set up automatically during installation.
* Extract the py launcher MSI to make the distribution substentially smaller.
* The installer now comes with both 64- and 32-bit flavours.
* The uninstaller is now added to registry, so you can remove SNAFU in Control Panel.


## Version 0.1

Initial release. Features I want the most are largely implemented. Only 64-bit Pythons are supported for now, and the installer is 64-bit-only.

An all-in-one installer that installs SNAFU into
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\SNAFU`, and sets up the py launcher.

* `snafu install/uninstall <version>`
* `snafu list [--all]`
* `snafu activate/deactivate <version> [<version> ...]`
